    <h1>The Best Movies According to Cody (That I Can Remember)</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <p><strong>The Simpsons Movie</strong></p>
    <p>This movie was my go-to sleep movie since I was a kid. It will forever be treasured.</p>
    <p><strong>Eternals</strong></p>
    <p>I love the superhero dynamic in this movie; a serious tone with deeper issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Futurama</strong></p>
    <p>This show has four movies created after the reboot. They are extremely funny and clever.</p>
